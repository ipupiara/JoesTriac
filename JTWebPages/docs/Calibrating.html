	<font size="4">The equipment can be used with a wide variety of current 
	sensors. Any current sensor that needs five voltages input (-2.5 to 2.5 in 
	our case) and which outputs the measured current as a voltage around 
	reference of half the neded input voltage (usually 2.5V, but 0V in our case) 
	should fit.</font><p><font size="4">In a first step, the expected range of 
	ampere usage and it's variation has to be estimated and defined. In our case 
	that was quite easy. Jo will use the equipment at 50 to 70 amperes and 
	hardly any time beyond this. </font></p>
	<p><font size="4">A current sensor that works within this range has to be 
	found. It should not be much oversized, so that it works in its ordinary, 
	appropriate range.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4">Then, whenever possible, a size of transformer should be 
	found which will need at least half of the sine-wave under triac regulation. 
	This is to keep the crest factor low and hence the precision as high as 
	possible. In our case we just had a transformer which will produce 120 amps 
	as maximum and the curve on the oscilloscope showed us, that a bit more than</font></p>

	<p><font size="4">&nbsp;half of 
	the sine wave is used under normal production (crest factor approx. 3. to 
	4). A somewhat smaller transformer would be better, but we had no other one.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4">On the ammeter board, the current sensor value is beeing 
	transformed to RMS (IC1 AD536) and AVG (IC2 and IC4 , each TLC251) values. 
	These two values then are amplified by IC5 and IC6. Now the amplification 
	has to be&nbsp; chosen by potentiometer R8 and R16 so that the average range 
	of usage sets the amplified values to about 3 to 4 volts, depending on the 
	possible variation of the range. This leads to optimal results in the analog 
	to digital conversion (ADC) within the ATmega CPU. </font></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font size="4">The zero value of the current sensor (the value during 
	idle time) has to be set on GND for maximaum precision. This is done 
	automatically during idle time of the triac controller by the assisting 
	processor (ATtiny84) via the digital potentiometer (IC8 on ammeterboard) in 
	a scale of 0 to 100 which is shown on the display during idle time (P 
	value). At the beginning, or if needed also from time to time, the value has 
	to be set to the value of 50 as close as possible via potentiometer R23. If 
	duing usage of the triac controller, this value ever should change 
	drastically this means that anything on the hardware changed drastically, 
	which in any case should be clarified.</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font size="4">The internal ampere calculator which calculates the 
	effective current value out of the rms value (or evtl. avg value) has to be 
	calibrated using an external ampere meter at the values of calibLowAmps and 
	calibHighAmps which currently still are hardcoded in jtdefines.h (but later 
	might be transferred to eeprom for better flexibility). The calibLowAmps 
	value is the first value from which onwards the scale is at greater 
	linearity than at zero. Anything like 10 amperes should be right. But 
	concerning calibHighAmps, it is 
	a good idea to set the calibHighAmps value to the value which is most often 
	needed by end-user. In Jo's case this was 60 amperes. This will ensure 
	maximal precision for the enduser, resp. a minimal interpolating error. So 
	if needed, it is worth to set these values in jtdefines.h, recompile, and 
	reload the application on the triac controller.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4">At startup of the application, the user is asked if he 
	wishes to calibrate during 5 seconds, before the application changes to idle 
	mode. If he presses yes, he first will be asked if he wishes rms or avg. In 
	normal case, rms should be used as long as an rms ampere-meter is available. 
	As next, the triac controller will calibrate ampere sensor so that the idle 
	value will become equal to GND. This will normally take approximately 1 or 2 
	minutes, but can lead to an endless loop in faulty hardware cases. Now, 
	using an external ampere meter, the 
	user will have to set the ampere-values produced to the values of 
	calibLowAmps and calibHighAmps by changeing the triac turn on time using the keypad (1,2,3 for 
	more current, 7,8,9 for 
	less current). Allways wait until the setting has become almost time-stable. This 
	will get the best calibration-values for production and will reduce 
	the error due to crest factor. Please be aware: Any two tested rms ampere 
	meters will probable show different values to the same current (as during 
	Dec 2011, maybe there will follow better ammeters once later). Just use 
	always the same ammeter and find out the welding-values which makes you 
	happy (which give the best results in production). </font></p>

	<p><font size="4">The calibration-values can be looked at and can be changed 
	under setup menu at idle mode. It is a good habit to write the two values 
	down, so that they can be entered manually later to prevent calibration 
	effort (what needs to be done 
	eg. after a next software download). Check the triac controller during 
	production from time to time by comparing the ampere-values shown on 
	display against the external values of the ammeter you used for calibration 
	(and do not be worried if they differ from the values shown by another 
	ammeter, as stated above).</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font size="4">Zerocross-detection: Calibrating the zerocross-detection 
	is rather easy. IC1 on the powerboard (LM311-comparator) compairs a constant 
	voltage (on pos. entry), which can be configured on poti R2, with the since 
	curve of the 12 V output of the trafo (on neg. entry). The ouput of LM311 is 
	a rectangular curve which shows accurately the zero cross position. Any 
	phase delay due to the power consumption on the secondary side of the trafo 
	is of no further impact, as could be checked with the oscilloscope. The 
	constant voltage has to be set so that the rectangular curve on the output 
	is formed cleary and shows a small part between the end of a cycle and the 
	start of the next one, but the gap should be too large, so that the earliest 
	possible triac triggering still is more or less possible.</font></p>
