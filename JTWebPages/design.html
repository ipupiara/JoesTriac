		<td valign="top" height="380" width="392"><u><b>Concurrency</b></u><p>On the lowest level of 
		processing there are the hardware interrrupts, which accept hadware 
		events (zero cross detection, keypad) and that handle the various timers 
		and ADC events. They store the events in global variables (called 
		interrupt-variables, owned by each interrupt), but they do not 
		take any direct action within the behaviour or model data of the application. 
		This separation&nbsp; was done for thread safety reasons concerning the 
		high concurrency of all events and processes.</p>
		<p>The behaviour of the application is handled within the context of the&nbsp; 
		main() process. The main() process polls for the hardware events stored 
		in global interrupt-variables, transforms them into fsm-events and lets 
		them process within the fsm state machine. Access to interrupt owend 
		data that take more than one clock cycle of the AVR CPU need 
		transaction-wide locking using cli() and sei() methods. If an interrupt 
		transaction needs more than one interrupt, as as is for example the case 
		in TWI (I2C), the main() process additionally needs to wait for 
		interrupt-transaction-finished, signalled on an int8_t interrupt 
		variable (eg. meesageOnGoing in ATtiny).</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><u><b>Behaviour handling</b></u></p>
		<p>The behaviour of the application was modelled using an fsm state 
		machine. The fsm state machine code was originally written for PCs but could 
		be easily transferred into AVR Studio 4.0 C-code. It allows nesting of states 
		and to perform transitions from any arbitrary state to any other. State 
		exit and entry methods are supported as well as methods bound to 
		transitions. Also state activities are supported as local transitions&nbsp; 
		together with various events like e.g. durationTimer events, ADC (Analog to 
		Digital Conversion) events or keypad events. All this makes handling of 
		nested states rather easy without the need of any state variables. 
		ATTENTION: The fsm code works only errorfree if it is compiled without 
		any optimizations (-O0), or eventually at some custom optimizations still 
		to be found.<p>The application contains an assisting processor (ATtiny84) which is 
		responsible for the zero calibration of the current sensor. It steers 
		the supply voltage for the sensor to a level that sets the zero signal 
		of the sensor exactly to GND. Communication between the main CPU 
		(ATmega644P) to the ATtiny is done via interrupt driven I2C 
		communication.<p>&nbsp;</td>
