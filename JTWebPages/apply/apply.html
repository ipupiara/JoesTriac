Working handicapped due to chronic pains</H1>

<div style="position: absolute; width: 827px; height: 589px; z-index: 1; left: 165px; top: 87px" id="layer1">
	<p align="left"><font size="4">In October 2003 I got victim of an accident. 
	A train crash happened in Zurich where I was sitting in the first wagon that 
	crashed. By the vehemence of the collison, my backbone got hurt by vertebra 
	compression fractures. Still today I suffer severe pains that completely 
	define the way I have to live. This also impacts how and what I can work. 
	Until now I was not able to work in a regular job due to the pains, but now 
	I try to find something applicable, but there are restriction what I am able 
	to do:</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font size="4">for example:</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="4">Especially long times sitting on chairs is 
	painful and after a certain time I have to stand up and move. Otherwise 
	it gets some kind of insufferable. </font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="4">The daily way to work should be as short as 
	possible. It would be efficient and helpful to do a main part of the work from my 
	home-office and to carefully plan the times we meet together in team (eg. 
	for design, analysis, code reviews, solution meetings for bugs, 
	iterations-to-solution planning, testing). Whenever required, I also can stay for a 
	couple of days at the working place (renting a cheap room or hotel) , either 
	on a regular base (eg. for two or three days per week) or just when required.</font></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="4">I need to be able do relax in laying position 
		somewhere in the office at any time between periods of work.</font></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="left"><font size="4">To lower the problem somewhat, I started to create on my own a &quot;some kind of all 
	position chairs&quot; out of a Stokke-Gravitiy chair. The Stokke-Gravitiy itself 
	is good for small people but for my size (1.80m) it needs some changes. For 
	example I had to add more beddings.</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font size="4">In this chair I can work longer than on an 
	ordinary chair and by the aid of pain-medicins I even can recover from minor 
	pains (while in case of severe pains I need to lay freely on a bed).</font></p>
	<p align="left"><font size="4">Now I am in search of a project where I can 
	work regularely in an R&amp;D team and I hope for a company that will accept a 
	person working in my circumstances.</font></p>

	<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>a planned additional wooden stick

	&nbsp;<p>
	next I will try to create a table which can be used in all position of the 
	chair as well as in standing position. This should be a&nbsp; metal 
	construction, so it's time to use my tig welding machine 
	once more.....<p>
